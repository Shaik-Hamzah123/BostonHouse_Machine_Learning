<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Pyhton
<li>Machine Learning
<li>Tensorflow
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days ootcamp,visit:
